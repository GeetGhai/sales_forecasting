📈 Sales Forecasting
This project aims to build a predictive model to forecast sales using historical sales data. The goal is to help businesses make informed decisions by anticipating future demand and optimizing resources accordingly.

🔍 Project Overview
The notebook Sales_Forecasting_Cleaned.ipynb walks through the process of:

Cleaning and preprocessing the sales data.

Exploring and visualizing the dataset.

Building a regression model to predict future sales.

Evaluating model performance with relevant metrics.
